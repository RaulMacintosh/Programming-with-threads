# Programming with threads

A undergraduate project for the class of Concurrent Programming. The objective is to verify whether or not the common sense is valid that concurrent programs perform better in relation to execution time when compared to their respective sequential versions. For this, the sequential and concurrent versions of an algorithm will be implemented and tests performed for different loads (workloads). By analyzing the results in terms of execution time recorded in each of the tests, it will be possible to conclude about the hypothesis initially given.
